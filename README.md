# My-Netflix-Dashboard
This project was developed for analysing personal Netflix viewing history data to uncover hidden patterns and trends using Power BI Query Editor. The original viewing history data consisting of only two columns, title and date, was split into 14 different columns such as season, episode name, category, month name, and year. The data was further visualised using various chart types such as line charts, waterfall charts, pie charts, tree maps, gauges, tables, funnels, and stacked bar charts. Discovered key insights: May had the highest views (183), over 50% of views occurred from Wednesday to Saturday, and 2020 had the most movies watched (29).
