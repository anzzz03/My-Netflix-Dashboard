# My-Netflix-Dashboard
This project was developed for taking a deeper dive into my Netflix account's viewing history data to discover hidden patterns and trends. The original viewing history data consisting of only two columns, Title and Date, was split into 14 different columns such as Season, Episode Name, Category, Month Name, Year etc. using Power BI Query Editor. This cleaned data was further visualized using Line charts, Waterfall charts, Pie charts, Treemaps, Gauges, Tables, Funnels and Stacked Bar Charts to discover that my maximum number of views have increased over the years with the month of May recording the highest views (183) and Wednesday - Saturday accounting for more than 50% of my views in a week. However, the year with the highest number of movies watched (29) was found to be 2020, which is pretty accurate considering the increased screen time and binge-watching during the Covid-19 lockdown period in the year 2020. This was an insightful project which helped me track my own watching habits as per different criteria.
